# Simple Calculator using Python Tkinter

This directory contains the source code for a simple graphical calculator application written in Python using the Tkinter library.
<br />

## Description

This Python code creates a basic calculator application with a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI is built using the Tkinter library, which is included in the standard Python distribution.

The calculator can perform the following arithmetic operations:

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (\*)
- Division (/)
- Exponentiation (x², implemented by entering "x²")
- Modulo (%)
- The calculator also includes buttons for:

- Clear entry (CE) - clears the current expression in the input field
- Clear all (C) - clears the entire input field
- Backspace (⌫) - deletes the last character from the input field
- Changing sign (+/-) - Inverts the sign of the current number in the input field

The calculator has a designated input field where the user can enter the expression they want to evaluate. Once the expression is entered, the user can click the equals (=) button to evaluate the expression and see the result displayed in the input field.

- calc v2 (Using CustomTkinter)

<br />

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (included in most standard Python installations)

- CustomTkinter library (v2)

<br />

## How to Run

1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., calculator.py).
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
3. Run the following command in the terminal:

<br/>

```python
python calculator.py
```

This will launch the calculator application.
